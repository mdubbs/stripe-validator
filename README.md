# stripe-validator :godmode:
Stripe jQuery.payment validator methods for jQuery.validation. They are not difficult to write, but if I save you 10-20 minutes that's a win in my book.

### Dependencies
[jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)

[jQuery.Validation](https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation)

[jQuery.Payment](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment)

### But wait there's more!
I also did some customization for Bootstrap 4 (alpha3)
